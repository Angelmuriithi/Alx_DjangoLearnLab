This is my first Django project created for the ALX Introduction to Django assignment.

Steps Followed
1. Installed Django using pip
2. Created the project named `LibraryProject`
3. Ran the development server successfully at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
4. Explored the Django project structure:
   - `settings.py`: Contains configuration for the project
   - `urls.py`: URL declarations for the project
   - `manage.py`: Command-line utility to manage this project
